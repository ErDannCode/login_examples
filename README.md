# login_examples

I am creating some examples for a login to practice in web development, you can see them all, or even use them! The code warns that it may be a bit dirty, but I will be constantly modifying them and adding some content to them.

Everything you are going to see is mainly created to practice frontend development, and in the future maybe even add JavaScript in some LOGINs, but the idea is usually with CSS and HTML.
